So this is super ad hoc, but it works for now.

Instructions for getting up and running:

1. Make sure you've got [NPM (it comes with Node)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) 
2. Go to the frontend directory (`cd frontend`)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run serve`
5. Open up [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser
